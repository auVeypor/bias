**Blackgate Information and Administration System (BIAS)**



**Overview:**

BIAS is a Teamspeak 3 administration and management suite, custom designed with Guild Wars 2 servers in mind.

BIAS is intended to be a collection of PHP scripts and web pages that leverage the Guild Wars 2 API developed by ArenaNet LLC and the Teamspeak 3 serverquery feature to automate and make possible many tasks that were difficult or impossible to achieve normally.
